title: I am invincible in these sunglasses

I am an unstoppable force of nature  
Nobody has ever dared to look me in my eyes  
They gaze at my arms but not for too long  
They glance at my legs for an even shorter amount of time  
They begin to obsess over my appearance   
For today I appear much taller  
And each day I grow  
I loom over the microscopic citizens of my village  
And they glue their eyes to the floor  
I am the pinnacle of adequacy   
I am the peak of mediocrity   
I am the best to do it  
This much is cemented in history
