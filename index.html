    <p>I WILL NOT LIE OR STEAL OR CHEAT</p>
    
      <p>I WILL LEARN SOMETHING NEW EVERYDAY</p>
<p>I WILL TRY MY BEST TO GET ALONG WITH OTHERS</p>
<p>I WILL BE GRATEFUL FOR THE EXPERIENCE REGARDLESS</p>
<p>I WILL NOT FORCE MYSELF TO BELONG SOMEWHERE I DO NOT WANT TO BE</p>
<p>I WILL COMMIT MYSELF TO SOMETHING THAT MAKES ME HAPPY</p>
<p>I WILL QUESTION THAT HAPPINESS AND BE UNAFRAID TO START OVER IF IT IS NO LONGER FULFILLING</p>
<p>I WILL SPEAK KINDLY OF MYSELF AND OTHERS</p>
<p>I WILL PUT MYSELF IN UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATIONS AND TRUST THAT THE SOLUTIONS WILL COME</p>
<P>I WILL LOOK AND VALUE INWARDS</P>
<P>I WILL CONFESS TO MY CRIMES AND ADMIT MY SHORTCOMINGS</P>
<p>I WILL NO LONGER AVOID THE TAX I MUST PAY</p>
