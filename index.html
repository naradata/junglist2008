      <ul>
        <li><a href="#home">home</a>-this is where you are right now. hello!</li>
        <li><a href="#articles">articles</a>- this is where i write about counterstrike. it's primarily focused on the pro scene- teams, players, matches, roster moves, or any other developments i find worth talking about.while it is mostly news structures, it's not strictly tied to what is happening <em>right now.</em> </li>
        <li><a href="#essays">essays</a>- this is a section for the writings that don't fit as neatly into match summaries or stat sheets. writings here are more research driven- sometimes directly connected to counterstrike, sometimes only loosely connected. while primarily academic based, counterstrike serves as a framework for all of these writings.</li>
        <li><a href="#dataandstats">data and stats</a>-this section serves as a purpose for me to evolve and progress in the data analysis side of counterstrike. it is quite open ended as i am still shaping what this section will become, but right now it is a place for playing with stats and seeing what patterns can emerge. </li>
        <li><a href="#surflogs">surf logs</a>-this is where i document my progress in surf, review maps, and showcase my own maps. i also have some hammer tutorials included here if interested in creating maps for any valve game.</li>
        <li><a href="#personal">personal</a>-this section acts like a journal for me where i can write whatever i am thinking about at any time of the day. however, most of the time i am thinking about counter strike.</li>
        <li><a href="#artwork">artwork</a>-i like making art sometimes. if i like it enough i will put it here. if you are an artist or editor or make any type of art and would like to be featured here, you can message me. if i like it enough i will put it here.</li>
